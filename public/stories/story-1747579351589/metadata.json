  "text": "It was a hot, sunny day in the savannah. A group of young animals were excited to go on their very first safari adventure. They had been preparing for weeks, packing their bags and practicing their map-reading skills. As they set off early in the morning, they couldn't wait to see all the amazing sights and creatures that the savannah had to offer.\n\nAs they journeyed deeper into the savannah, they saw incredible animals such as giraffes, zebras, and elephants. They even caught a glimpse of a majestic lion in the distance. The young animals were having the time of their lives, but they soon realized that they had forgotten to pack something very important â€“ water!\n\nAs the sun began to beat down on them, they knew they needed to find a source of water quickly. They searched high and low, but every stream and pond they came across was dry. Just when they were about to give up hope, they stumbled upon a small oasis in the middle of the savannah. There, they found a cool, refreshing pool of water that was just what they needed to quench their thirst.\n\nMoral: Always be prepared and never take things for granted, or you might find yourself in a sticky situation!",
