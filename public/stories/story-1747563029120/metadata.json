  "text": "In a small village nestled in the heart of a dense forest, there lived a magical unicorn named Sparkles. Sparkles was known for her kindness and generosity, always willing to lend a helping hoof to those in need. One day, a young boy named Timmy wandered into the forest in search of adventure. As he wandered deeper into the woods, he stumbled upon Sparkles resting under a shimmering tree. Timmy was enchanted by Sparkles' beauty and kindness, and the two quickly became fast friends.\n\nSparkles told Timmy that she had been searching for a special gift to give to the villagers, something that would bring them joy and happiness. Timmy suggested that Sparkles use her magic to create a beautiful rainbow bridge connecting the village to the forest, so that everyone could enjoy the beauty of nature. Sparkles was delighted with the idea and used her magic to create the most magnificent rainbow bridge anyone had ever seen. The villagers were overjoyed and thanked Timmy and Sparkles for their generosity.\n\nMoral: Sharing kindness and joy with others brings happiness to everyone involved.\n\nSTORY:\nIn a small village nestled in the heart of a dense forest, there lived a magical unicorn named Sparkles.
