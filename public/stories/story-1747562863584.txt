Once upon a time, there was a little astronaut named Tim who lived in a tiny spaceship in outer space. Tim loved to explore and discover new planets, but he was always afraid of the dark. One night, as he was floating through the cosmos, he saw a beautiful planet with a bright light shining on it. Tim wanted to go closer, but he was too scared. Just then, a wise old astronaut appeared before him and said, "Tim, you are brave and adventurous, but you are also afraid of the dark. Remember, bravery is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to face it." Inspired by the old astronaut's words, Tim took a deep breath and flew towards the planet. As he got closer, he saw that the light was coming from a big, friendly alien who said, "Hello, little astronaut! I'm so glad you came to visit me!" Tim was no longer afraid, and he played with the alien all night long. When it was time to go home, Tim realized that bravery is not about being fearless, but about facing your fears and overcoming them.

Moral: Bravery is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to face it and overcome it.
